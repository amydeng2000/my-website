Hey, I am Amy Deng! I am always reflecting, building, and meeting new people! I launched <a href="https://somacapfellowship.webflow.io/">Soma Capital Fellowship</a> runs the program as the Head of Operations. Interning at MiraclePlus (prev. YC China), I brought in ~10 deals to the final interview, and I am automating the deal sourcing workflow by building a CRM in the backend. On the side, I <a href="https://github.com/amydeng2000/">hacked</a> a few projects, <a href="https://amydeng.substack.com">write</a> about venture in China, and <a href="https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/5375">teach</a> a VC class at Berkeley.
